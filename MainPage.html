        <li><b><i>It wasn’t always called Origami.</i></b> The initial 1500 years or so of its existence,
             origami was actually known as orikata, a Japanese word that translates to “Folded Paper”.
              It was in 1880 that the name of the art form was changed to origami, derived from two 
              Japanese words; oru, meaning to fold, and kami, meaning paper.
 
</li>
<br>
<li><b><i>Origami was first only practiced by the Elite.</i></b> Paper was originally created sometime around
     100 A.D. While paper is considered a common and cheap commodity now, at the time of its
      conception, the resources required to create paper were not as easily available. Paper was
       an expensive and rare commodity, so those engaging in the art of traditional paper folding
        was usually an art left for the elite rungs of society. Conversely, it was also used by Buddhist
         Monks for religious purposes. It only later became a practice open to the public.
</li>
<br>
<li>
  <b><i>  It is a major part of Japanese Wedding Rituals.</i></b>Speaking of surprising uses, one very important 
    function origami plays is in Japanese Wedding Rituals. Origami Butterflies and other simple designs 
    are often given along with gifts and paper wrapping, but most important is the presentation of 1000 
    paper cranes.There are two manners in which this marriage tradition is known to be carried out.
     The first is the practice of sembazuru, an age-old ritual in which the soon-to-be-wed couple 
     folds the cranes themselves, to be strung up and decorate their wedding hall. Another tradition 
     that used to be followed was the gifting of 1000 cranes to the bride-to-be from her father. These 
     traditions come from the belief that folding of 1000 cranes would grant the holder with one special wish.
</li>
<br>
<li>
  <b><i>  The first book about Origami was written in 1797.</i></b> first book ever published about Origami was 
    entitled “Sembazuru Orikata” (Thousand Crane Folding), and was largely about the timeless custom 
    of folding a 1000 paper cranes for traditional weddings. Written by Akisato Rito, the book speaks
     of the legend behind the wish granted by folding this gargantuan number of cranes.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <b><i>Origami Used to be gifted by Samurai to each other.</i></b>As a good luck token for all the future 
    dangers to be faced, Samurais commonly used to present gifts of origami to each other. These
     gifts were usually a type of ceremonial origami, folded from multiple pieces of paper into 
     intricate shapes and presented along with a strip of dried fish or meat, to signify “good wishes”.
